My design career started in 2020 when I became the State Reporter for The Texas Technology Student Association where my duties included communication with other chapters through newsletters and creating social media content primarily using Canva. Some of my work can be found on their Instagram from the spring of 2020 - the spring of 2021. Through this organization, I placed nationally in events such as Engineering Design and Development and competed in Fashion Design, Video Production, Prepared Presentation, etc.
