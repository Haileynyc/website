I am a UX/UI designer studying at the University of Texas, 
at Austin (Hook â€˜Em!) I am currently majoring in Environmental Engineering, but hope to switch into Informatics with a focus in UX/UI. I am pursuing a certificate in Elements of Computing. I love anything that involves design and technology!
